# React + Vite

Frontend - Dynamic Form Application
This is the frontend for the Dynamic Form Application. It is built with React and handles user interactions, form submissions, and data validations. Users can fill out personal details, upload a salary slip (for incomes above 50,000), and submit the data to the backend.

Features
Dynamic Form: Form fields dynamically adapt based on the userâ€™s input.

Salary Slip Upload: Upload functionality for salary slip when annual income exceeds 50,000.

Form Validation: Required fields and percentage validation for members.

Responsive UI: Built with Ant Design components for a smooth user experience.

Prerequisites
Before running the frontend application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v14.x or higher)

npm (Node Package Manager)

Environment Variables:

Additional Information
